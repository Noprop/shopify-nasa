## Info

This project was made using NextJS, DayJS, and Shopify's component library [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/).

## Getting Started

First, generate a key from the NASA API [here](https://api.nasa.gov/). Duplicate the .env.local-example file, rename to .env.local, and then place your key in there.

Next (lol), run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
